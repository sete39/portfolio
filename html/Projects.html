                During the past three years I have spent in the American University of Sharjah, I have worked on many different projects and am also working on some projects right now. This is a collection
                of some of the work I have done in my own personal time and as coursework for certain courses.

            <h2>Completed Projects</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    Used deep learning methods to test different convoloutional nerual networks (CNN) that would predict 
                    a bird species from the sounds the bird would make. After creating a data set for around 10000 different audio files containing the
                    bird sound (around a thousand for each species), the audio files would be converted to spectrograms and fed into the CNN, which would attempt to 
                    predict the bird species. The CNN with the best results produced an accuracy of 81% (correctly predicted 81% of the birds) and average AUC of 0.88.
                    The code for the project was written using Python and the Keras library.
                </li>
                <br>
                <li>
                    Developed a healthcare family monitoring system to be used to by hospitals. The system consisted of a desktop application that would be used by
                    the adminstrators, doctors, patients, and the family of the patient and of a database. The database contained info of all the different users accounts
                    and of all the medicine/vitals that a patient would have take. The application was used to keep track of patients by the doctors and for patients to remember 
                    to take their medicine. This application was developed using Agile methods as a team four, and the necessary documentation, 
                    such as the Software Requirments Specification and the many different diagrams, was also made and written down.

                    Developing a smart home IoT-based security system with its own mobile application and website. My group and I are still currently working on this project and 
                    idea is not complete, however, so far, we are planning to use a camera that would have facial recognition to recognize if it is the people living in the house 
                    who are caught on camera or another stranger not recognized by the AI that we would be using for the facial recognition.
                    We will also add proximity sensors or pressure sensor to important places in the house, such as the safe, to detect if someone is trying to access or take 
                    something from them. The user would be warned if any suspicious person was detected via a push notification from the app/website, and would also be able to turn off
                    the security system if need be. There will also be a server with a MongoDB database that stores videos, photos and other important information.
                    the application will be written in Dart using the Flutter framework, and we are writing the server code with JavaScript (Node.js).

                    For me and my group's senior design project, we are designing and developing an intelligent parking system. The system will consist of a mobile application on the user's
                    side and a server that (we are hoping) would connect to RTA's database. The system will read data about the parking zones, such as the amount of free parking lots, 
                    around Dubai and send that information to the server. The user would be able to search for an area they would like to go to, with all sorts of different filters such as free,
                    shaded, etc., and they would be shown the parking zones closest to that area. We also plan on using the data we get to do some machine learning to predict the number of free spaces
                    at different times of the day and display that info on the application to allow people plan the time they would like to go to a certain destination.

                    During my free time in the last summer break, I have been learning mobile application development with Flutter. To help me learn, I decided to make a mobile application that
                    would allow people to search for their gaming accounts and find different statistics about their account. Although I haven't been able to fully complete the application, it is
                    mostly done. The application communicates with an API (that I wrote using Flask on Python) on a server that is hosted on Google Cloud. The API would communicate with the game company's 
                    API to get the user's data, and then modify the JSON to be used by the application. After the user would search for an account, the application would display the games played 
                    on the account and all the relevant information
