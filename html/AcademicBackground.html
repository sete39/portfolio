                As a student at the American University of Sharjah studying to get a Bachelor of Science in Computer Engineering, I have learned a lot of things
                relating to my major. In addition to my bachelor's degree, I'm taking two minors, one in Computer Science and the other in Data Science.
                Although I do lack work experience, as a senior student, I have taken many courses related to my major which have given me
                a great amount of experience working with many different technologies related to the field. Some of these courses are:

                I have also done many different projects for the courses, and some others which I am doing right now, and you can find these in the Projects page.
                My graduation date is also coming close, as I will be graduating in the coming semester (May 2021)!
